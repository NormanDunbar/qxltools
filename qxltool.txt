qxltool
=======

qxltool is a program to access QXL.WIN files from a native operating
system (Linux, DOS, Win 3.x, Win 95, NT, OS2, or even QDOS). 

qxltool allows read (and optionally), write access to the QXL.WIN
file, making directories, deleting, formatting etc.

PLEASE ENSURE YOUR QXL.WIN FILE IS BACKED UP BEFORE USING qxltool, as:

1. The documentation covering QXL.WIN files is subject to the usual
   QDOS 'Official Secrets Act' and is not (to the author's knowledge)
   openly and freely available to non-commercial programmers. This
   program is based on the only available information, 'qxlwin.html'
   as provided in the UQLX distribution. Sad, isn't it ? Why don't the
   vendors put this sort of useful info on their web sites ? Can't be
   that they don't like useful free programs that you haven't paid
   for, or that they are just waiting for QDOS to die because no
   one knows how to program it. No, that would be foolish. Beats me.

2. Given the sad documentation situation, you might not like the idea
   of my program writing to your QXL.WIN file. That's your choice.

If qxltool corrupts your precious data, then more fool you for using it;
still, you can blame the information hoarders.

The file qxlwin.html on which this program is based contains
significant errors! You have been warned.

I would also caution STRONGLY against running QXL and qxltool at the same
time. Actually, I'd recommend that you don't run QXL at all; install
Linux, use uqlx, and qxltool to transfer the files out of the QXL.WIN
file into the Unix file system. Just so NO to closed software.

License

GPL: Please see file 'COPYING'.

Installation
============

Unix
----

To install the supplied binary on Linux (or other Unix)

   1) cd Unix
   2) ./configure
   3) make
   4) strip qxltool
   5) # copy qxltool to a suitable location

DOS & OS2
---------

Find a compiler, write a Makefile and build

Win32 (Win95, Win98, NT)
------------------------

Copy the file nt\qxltool.exe onto your path.

or

   1) cd NT
   2) ./configure
   3) make
   4) strip qxltool.exe
   5) # copy qxltool.exe to a suitable location

QDOS
----

The qxltool source compiles under c68 (and runs :-). 

Copy the file QDOS_qxltool to a suitable directory.

Test Status
===========

The different OS varients of qxltool have been tested by the author as 
follows:

	OS		Status
	--------------------------
	Linux		Tested
	NT/Win9x	Tested, marginally
	QDOS		Not Tested
	DOS		Not Tested
	OS2		Not Tested

Usage
=====

qxltool needs to know where the QXL.WIN file is located; in order of
precedence:

	1. From the command line
		qxltools file_name
	2. From the environment
	3. Defaults
		/dos/QXL.WIN	 (Linux)
		C:\QXL.WIN	 (DOS,Win*,OS2)
		win2_tmp_qxl.win (QDOS)

The environment variable is named QXL_FILE and may be set as:

    Linux
    (sh, bash, ksh)	
	   export QXL_FILE=/dos/QXL.WIN

    (csh,tcsh)
	   setenv QXL_FILE /dos/QXL.WIN


     DOS etc
	   set QXL_FILE=H:\QXL.WIN

     QDOS
           setenv "QXL_FILE=win2_tmp_qxl.win"

(Obviously) the file name is setup dependent.

qxltool defaults to a readonly QXL.WIN file to protect your data,
if you're feeling brave, you can run qxltool is read-write mode
by giving a '-w' option.

	qxltool -w /cdrom/qxl.win

A single command can be given with a -c option.

	qxltool -c lslr /tmp/qxl.win

qxltool can attempt to format and use a virgin QXL.WIN file by giving
more than three non-option parameters:

	qxltool -w file_name size_in_MB Label0 ... LabelN 

	for example:

	qxltool -w /tmp/qxl.win 8 QXL Disk Label

	Would create an 8Mb QXL file (/tmp/qxl.win) with a disk label
	"QXL Disk Label".

In order to format an existing QXL file (or partition), then you must
give a -W option. This is to protect people from accidentally
formatting an existing file/partition.


	qxltool -W /tmp/oldqxl.win 8 QXL Disk Label

Under QDOS, the console window will fill the display by default. You
can change the size of the display using the singularly appropriate
environment variable "QXL_CON".

     For example:
           setenv "QXL_CON=484x240a16x10"

qxltool presents you with a prompt '> ', and accepts the following
commands.

	info	-	Shows some info about the QXL.WIN file
	ls	-	Lists the current QXL.WIN directory
	lslr	-	Lists the current QXL.WIN directory and all 
                        sub-directories.
	cat	-	types or copies a file from QXL.WIN
	cp	-	types or copies a file from QXL.WIN
	cd	-	changes the QXL.WIN working directory
	pwd	-	displays the current QXL.WIN directory
	exit	-	exits the qxltool program
	quit	-	exits the qxltool program
	write	-	write a file to the QXL.WIN file.
	rm	-	Deletes a file
	rmdir	-	Deletes an empty directory
	version -	Displays version number
	help	-	Displays some unhelpful text
	dump    -	Dumps out whole directory structure, including
			inconsistent entries (0 or -ve file size
			with name length and/or valid cluster pointer.
			Viewing this information may not do much for
			your confidence in the QPC or QXL software
			that wrote the original QXL.WIN, particularly
			given the state of the documentation.
        init	-	Initialises exisiting QXL.WIN
        mkdir	-	Creates a directory. There must be no name
			clash with an existing file.
        open	-	Opens a new QXL.WIN file
        close	-	Closes current QXL.WIN file
        format	-	Create a new QXL.WIN file
        shell	-	Spawns a shell
	clone	-	copies all or part of a QXL.WIN file to
			another QXL.WIN file.
        RW      -	Sets read-write mode for filesystem (O_RDWR)
	RO	-	Sets read-only mode for filesystem (O_RDONLY)

	and for mc68000 systems only, as the geometry coding has yet
	to be revealed (no doubt RZ will crack that too!).

	fix_geometry -  Fixes the disk geometry to what SMSQ expects


qxltool also accepts commands from a file using normal STDIN
redirection, useful for populating a QXL.WIN file for use with the
QPCDEMO program.

    qxltool <mycommands

Or, for Unix at least, using shell 'here-doc' syntax.

    #/bin/sh
    
    echo "Create a new QXL file for QPCDemo

    qxltool <<EOF
    wr boot
    mkdir exe
    cd exe
    wr /ql/exe/qtpi 
    wr /ql/exe/unzip
    cd
    mkdir extn
    cd extn
    wr /ql/qlsoft/qpac2 
    EOF

    echo "OK done that"

Commands may have their output redirected. 

	 >file	  - redirect output to 'file' and overwrite.
	 >>file	  - redirect output to 'file' and append.
	 | prog	  - pipes output to 'pipe'

Please note that '| prog' syntax requires a real operating system and
will not work on DOS, Win 3.* or Win95. It is currently untested on NT
or OS2.

It is, of course, perfectly functional for Linux.

   > cat boot | vless

I expect it also works for QDOS.

For 'DOS like' (DOS,Win 3*, Win 95, NT, OS2) operating systems,
redirected files for 'cat' and 'cp' are opened in binary mode and thus
do not translate QDOS LF to 'DOSlike' CR/LF. This translation may be
forced by the commands 'tcat' and 'tcp'.

   > tcat boot >boot.txt

In such OS, it is also possible to write DOS text (CR/LF) files to the
QXL.WIN file removing the CR, using the 'twrite' command.

Command Details
---------------

Please note that for your convenience, 'qxltool' uses the standard
concept of a current working directory; listing and copying works from
the current directory or relative to it.

All examples are taken from the demo QXL.WIN file on Peta Ja\"ger's
web site. 

Comments are preceeded by a hash.

cd: Changes the current working directory.

When a QDOS program is copied using 'cat' or 'cp', then if the output
device is 'seekable' (a file, not a pipe or terminal), then an 'XTcc'
data block (as used by the xtc68 cross compiler) is added to the
executable. These XTcc blocks are recognised by QLAY, uqlx/qcp and
some versions of InfoZip's Zip program to preserve QDOS data space for
executable programs.

info: Returns information about the QXL.WIN file
-----------------------------------------------

Information is returned as follows:

 > info
 Info for QXL file /tmp/qxl.win
 Label QPCD [QPCDEMO]
 Sector size 2048 bytes
 Total sectors 1536 (3.00 Mb, on disk 3145728 b)
 Free  sectors 68 (136.00 Kb)

Note that the tested QXL.WIN file, the volume label length does not
agree with the length of volume label. In this case, qxltool will display
what it believes to be the correct volume label in square brackets
(see line 2 of the example above). Choose who you believe. Of course,
the non-existant documentation might be wrong ....

write: copies a file into the QXL.WIN file system. 
--------------------------------------------------

 > write native/file.spec file_spec
 > write native/file.spec

This command takes one for two parameters. The first is the native
(Linux/DOS/Win etc) file name, the second is, optionally the name the
file will have in the QXL.WIN file system. If the second parameter is
not given, the QDOS file name is constructed by removing any directory
part and replacing '.' with '_'.

Note that the above examples have the same effect. Likewise

 > cd FAX
 > write qxltool.c

 > cd
 > wr qxltool.c FAX_qxltool_c

do the same.

On DOS-like systems the 'twrite' ('twr') command translates DOS CR/LF
to QDOS LF.

 > twr DOS.txt
 > twr readme.txt readme_txt

init: Initialises exisiting QXL.WIN

 > mkdir FAX_TEST

 or

 > cd
 > cd FAX
 > mkdir TEST

There must be no name clash (so unlike QDOS, you cannot have existing
candidate files for the new directory).

open: Opens a new QXL.WIN file.

 > open				# opens the default file
 > open /tmp/qxl.test

close: closes currently open file.
---------------------------------

 > close

format: Create a new QXL.WIN file
---------------------------------

With no parameters, you are asked for new file name, size in Mb and
label.

 > format

You may, if you wish, give these parameters as part of the command. 

 > format /tmp/qxl.demo 8 This is an 8MB file

The above line creates an 8Mb QXL file (/tmp/qxl.demo), with the label
"This is an 8MB file".

shell: Spawns a shell
---------------------

 > shell
 
Type 'exit' in the shell to return to qxltool.

You may also give shell commands.

 > shell ls *.[ch]

> shell ls -l *.[ch]
 -rw-r--r--   1 jrh      users       33195 Apr 21 19:35 qxltool.c
 -rw-r--r--   1 jrh      users        2048 Apr 21 18:27 qxltool.h
 -rw-r--r--   1 jrh      users          23 Apr 21 18:27 version.h

The shell command uses the environment variable SHELL (Unix) or
COMSPEC (DOSlike) to find the default shell.

QDOS also uses the environment variable "SHELL" to find a shell. This
may be usable with, for example, Adrian Ives
(Adrian_Ives@classic.msn.com) "shell" program.

RW: Sets read-write mode for filesystem (O_RDWR)
------------------------------------------------
RO: Sets read-only mode for filesystem (O_RDONLY)
-------------------------------------------------

Above commands change read-write permissions.

clone: Clones all or part of an QXL.WIN file
--------------------------------------------

 > clone src-spec dst-spec 

The clone command copies some or all files from an QXL.WIN file to
another QXL.WIN file. The copy may be to and from any arbitary
directory. One of the QXL files is the existing, open file and the
other is given in the command. You can copy either to or from the
current file. The 'other' QXL.WIN file (i.e. the one not currently
open is specified as:

     FilenameSeparatorDirectory

     where the separator is 

     ':'   for Unix and QDOS
     ';'   for DOS/Win/OS2

The specifier for the open QXL.WIN file is just a directory name,
with a single '_' used to indicate the top level directory. 

Note that a '#' introduces a commentary.

Some examples may help.

$ qxltool /tmp/test.win		# open an existing QXL file
> RW				# make it read-write
> clone /dos/qpc.win:_ qpc	# copy the whole of the QPCDEMO 'disk'
				# into a directory 'qpc_'
> cd
> ls
  qpc                                        640       (Directory) 
> cd qpc

If you're copying to or from the top level directory of the 'other'
QXL.WIN, then you can omit the '_'.

> clone /dos/qpc.win:_ qpc	# copy the whole of the QPCDEMO 'disk'
> clone /dos/qpc.win: qpc	# copy the whole of the QPCDEMO 'disk'

However the local top level directory must be denoted by '_'.

Helpers : qxlcopy.pl
--------------------

The example script qxlcopy.pl shows how you can copy a whole QXL.WIN
onto a native filesystem (where native == OS you're running
under). This has been tested under Linux, NT and QDOS (uqlx). Yes,
contrary to the mis-informed crap printed in QUANTA that you have to
program Linux in C or ASM, we know that that perl is just one of
__dozens__ of languages you can program in Linux. (I have this theory
that you can tell when an operating system is in terminal decline;
instead of promoting it, its proponents restort to slagging off the
alternatives). Anyway, I digress.

The document "xfer/xfer.txt" describes some methods by which you might
move a large binary file between systems.

Compiling
---------

qxltool, as distributed, compiles with gcc under Linux to produce the
distributed Linux binary. dos-gcc is used, under Linux, to product the
'DOSLike' binary. Porting to a native DOSLike compiler may produce a
smaller binary at the loss of binary portability. Porting for other
ANSI compilers should be easy. If you do not have the GNU 'readline',
use the dos-gcc (__GO32__) solution; you may also need to remove a few
other GNU-isms.

The Win32 version is compiled with gcc for Win32 (mingw32).

QLqxltool compiles using c68 (or at least xtc68), adopting the
Makefile for QDOS should be trivial.
