1. For Unix & Windows NT

   make 

   copy qxltool to a suitable place


2. MSDOS

   make dos


3. QDOS

   make qdos


4. For Linux Mint 19 (and others?)

   Make sure that you have installed libreadline-dev package or "readline/readline.h not found"
   errors will result. (Sudo apt install libreadline-dev worked for me.)

   cd Unix
   ../configure
   make
