This repository is a {\itshape work in progress} to attempt to save the source code for a very useful utility -\/ well, useful to some!

It\textquotesingle{}s the {\ttfamily Qxltools} utility written by Jonathan Hudson originally, but the source code has vanished from sight over the years and some people want the utility updating.

It could happen! \+:o)
